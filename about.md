The purpose of the proposed IEA Wind Task is to coordinate international research in the field of wind farm flow control. Technology to be considered within this Task will cover a broad range but will focus on the control algorithms and technologies, and how they translate into real-world performance gains.

The proposed scope is to gather ongoing research results as well as state-of-the-art in industrial practice, create an overview of control technologies and algorithms and explore how uncertainties affect the performance and potential for adoption of wind farm flow control.

The result is guidance for the wind industry and researchers on the current control algorithms, requirements, impediments to adoption, future directions and expected benefits of wind farm flow control.

Specifically the aim is to support the strategic initiatives of IEA Wind TCP by:

- **Maximizing the value of wind energy in systems and markets** by increasing the energy which can be produced from wind power plants

- **Lowering the cost of land-based and offshore wind energy** by reducing the wake induced loading of the wind turbines

- **Foster collaborative research and the exchange of best practices and data** by developing benchmarks and best practices for realistic wind farm flow control models and ensuring easy access to the most up to date knowledge, algorithms and ideas within wind farm control.

The task is aimed at the Advanced Technology priority area, but also affects Resource and Site Characterization by making flow conditions controllable and Energy Systems with High Amounts of Wind by making power production more controllable and predictable.

This is expected to be a four year effort.
